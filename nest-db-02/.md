->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>folder structure----<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<!-- main root file of the project  -->

1.  main.ts

 <!-- main module of the entire app-->

2.  app.module.ts
    --each module will be import and export from this file

 <!-- main controller of the entire app-> -->

3.  app.controller.ts
    --each controller will be import and export from this file

 <!-- main controller of the entire app-> -->

4.  app.service.ts
    --A basic service with a single method (will be stored all logic)

5.  app.controller.spec.ts
    -- it contains the test cases.

// we can create user defined module (will be the only controller file)
-> by manual create folder like users than users.module.ts
// by using cli it will automatically imported
-> >nest g module (module name) like tweet

// we can create user defined controller (will be only get ,post,put... logic )
-> by manual create folder like users than users.module.ts
// by using cli it will automatically imported
-> >nest g controller (controller name) like tweet

// we can create user defined services (will be my logic of controller method )
-> by manual create folder like users than users.service.ts
// by using cli it will automatically imported
-> >nest g service (service name) like tweet

1. ->CONTROLLER : used for api method like get,post,delete...
2. ->MODULE : used for controlling all controller
3. ->SERVICE : used for actuall logic of controller
4. ->PIPE :to transform and validate incoming data before it reaches a controllerâ€™s route handler.
5. ->DTO : Defines the structure of the data that will be transferred between different layers or services in the application.

5.1. -> in DTO we use 3rd party package class-validator for validation
->npm i class-transformer

6. -> Global scoped pipes
   main.ts
   async function bootstrap() {
   const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
   app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({
   whitelist:true -> it will not accept any extra propert by the handler()
   forbidNonWhitelisted: true -> If set to true, instead of stripping non-whitelisted properties validator will throw an error

   })); ->it is applied to every route handler across the entire application.
   await app.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3000);
   }
   bootstrap();

---> then no need to add pipe on each controller file

7. ->Mapped types:
   In NestJS, Mapped Types allow us to create new types or DTOs based on existing ones by modifying or transforming their properties. This is particularly useful when working with Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), as it helps reduce duplication and makes it easier to create versions of DTOs for different operations (e.g., partial updates, read-only objects).
   ->npm i @nestjs/mapped-types

8. ->Dependency Injecetion
   Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows a class to receive its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. In NestJS, DI is a core feature that helps manage and inject dependencies (such as services, repositories, and other providers) into different parts of the application, improving modularity, testability, and flexibility.

9. to create formated resources
   nest g res (resources name like ) auth

10. middleware
    1 functional Middleware


12.  Configuration before using db connection
    import it in app.module
11. Db Connect
    import it in app.module
